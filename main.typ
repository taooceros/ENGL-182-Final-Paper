= School of Slavery

#h(2em) Slavery is not natural, which means that it requires a special curriculum of maintaining the current state of slavery. The curriculum is designed to make slaves believe that they are born to be slaves, and they should not fight back. This curriculum mainly include two parts: one to convince them as subhuman, and the other to promote their ignorance. 

== Subhumanity

#h(2em) The first part of the curriculum is to convince slaves that they are born as slaves.
In the autobiography by Frederick Douglass, slaves are not allowed to know his birthday @douglass[p. 1]. Any inquery about birthday will result in serious punishment. By depriving the privilege of knowing birthday, slaves are deprived of the ability of knowing their growth as a human. This treatment is effective in making them feeling that they are as animal in the house, as animals are also not "allowed" to know their birthday. Further, whenever slaves are born, they must be separated from their mother for a couple of years. Therefore, slaves are being deprived of the privilege of having a family. For example, Douglass are having very little memory of his mother @douglass[p. 2]. Even though Douglass's mom tried her best to get in touch with Douglass, spending the whole night walking miles to see him, Douglass is not able to have a beloved impression from his mom. Further, when his mother are sick and finally die, Douglass is not allowed to present, or even know the information @douglass[p. 3].

This lesson has a special variant for female slaves. The ability to perform sexual assault has provided the slaveholder an effective weapon to convince female slaves that they are their property. As an example, Dr. Flint has performed various sexual abuse on the young Linda, polluting her young mind with the unclean image, where "only a vile monster can think of" @jacobs[p. 39]. Dr. Flint consistently asserting that Linda is his property, and she is forced to live under the same roof as Dr. Flint, and also bear with his suffocative surveillance. All this creates a deep impression on Linda, that she is a property of Dr. Flint.
